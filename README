This is a simple World of Warcraft neutral auction house bot. It
watches the neutral auction house for cross-faction item
transfers. That is, it's looking for people putting up expensive items
for only one copper so that they can buy it on another character. This
bot will buy anything selling for less than 1 silver.

You will need to presort the items by bid, ascending, and move the
scroll bar to the top. It's tuned to my exact screen resolution, so
you'll have to adjust for your own screen. All you need to do is set
all of the Point constants appropriately.

Don't ask me for help.
